# To-Do : Write a JS Program to use ToLower case method of String.


Strings have characters as elements.JavaScript counts positions of characters (index numbers) from zero. In the below example, we have a string and we have converted the string into Lowercase (small letters) by using the toLowerCase() method. Then we have printed the new string using console.log() method. Notice how small letters in the given string remains the same but capital letters are converted into small letters

Hint:

- open **practice01.js**
- Copy the below code in that file.
- Commit your changes to show the output in pipeline

```js
var string = "Konfinity TECHNOLOGY";

var newstring = string.toLowerCase();

console.log("lower case string is ", newstring);
```
