# To-Do : Program of Upper-Case Strings

Strings have characters as elements. JavaScript counts positions of characters (index numbers) from zero. In the below example, we have a string and we have converted the string into Uppercase (Capital letters) by using the toUpperCase() method. Then we have printed the new string using the console.log() method. Notice how capital letters in the given string remains the same but small letters are converted into capital letters

Hint:

- open **practice01.js**
- Copy the below code in that file.
- Commit your changes to show the output in pipeline

```js
var string = "Konfinity TECHNOLOGY";

var newstring = string.toUpperCase();

console.log("upper case string is ", newstring);
```
