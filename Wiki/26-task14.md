# String Exercise 14


**Open file named task14.js** and Write a JS function which takes 3 arguments: a sentence (string), 
a character and a flag (number).The function checks whether the character appears in the given sentence. 
If no, the function returns false.
 If the value of flag is 1, function returns the part of string before that character appears in the sentence. 
 If the flag is 2, the function returns the part of sentence which exists after the given character in the sentence.
  Sample Input: string = "Learn programming & start earning", character = "&", flag = 2. 
  Expected Output = " start earning".

Hint:

- Create a function with name and parameters
- Declare local variables and assign values
- Use if else to check if the character appears in the string
- Use split method to divide the string into 2 parts and return left/right part
- Return the result
- Export your function using below command:

```js
module.exports = YourFunctionName;
```
