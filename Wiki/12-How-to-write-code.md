# It will explain you how to write code and submit exercise on Workspace

Hi Konfinity Member, I hope you have learned enough to start your exercises (tasks). It is very important to solve
the tasks at the time of learning because:

- Your progress will be shared with the companies and help you in interviews
- it will help us to track your progress and help you when you need us the most.

In this article, you will learn the format in which you have to write code and
submit exercises on Konfinity's workspace environment.


**Please carefully follow the steps below:**


* The first step is to define a function with any name, parameters (if required) and curly brackets `{ } `. We recommend you to use `const` here to prevent unexpected behavior.
* The second step is to write your code between the curly brackets `{ }`
* Assign the function to `module.exports` using `=` . You will learn more about `module.exports` in future modules. For now, just use the below code:

```
module.exports = YourfunctionName ;
```


In the below example, we have defined a arrow function Konfinity and assigned it to `module.exports`. Arrow function is a new way to write functions and we will discuss more on this in future modules.  
```js
const konfinity = (p1,p2,p3,..) => {  //line 1
  //your code here         //line 2
  //Create an output variable and store the result in it  //line 3
  //Return the output variable   //line 4
};

module.exports = konfinity; //line 5
```

Please note that all the input variables in your exercises (tasks) will be assigned to the parameters in the function.

- For eg, if you are writing a function to calculate the area of a triangle, the function will have 2 parameters to store 2 input variables (`base` and `height`)

This will help us to test your code.



**Note**- We try our best to reply asap, but because of so many requests,
 it may take us a while to reply. will revert you as earliest for the same.

Happy Coding!
